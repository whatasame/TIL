# TIL

The best way to learn is to program by hand.

## How to do

Implement what I've learned in the following directories.

- labs: Projects for cloning, tutorials, etc.
- languages: Learn the syntax of programming language or its features.
- mysql: SQL script for MySQL.
- spring: Sample code including tests for the Spring framework.

## Rules

- Test code should run anywhere, anytime.
- Make writing test code as easy to understand as possible.

## Commit convention

Commit message must be consist of a `tag: message`. Possible tag are...

- repo: Manages the entire repository.
- build: Modify dependencies.
- test: Tasks related to testing.
- docs: Deal with any documentations.
